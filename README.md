# picture-cropper
An App to batch crop pictures to a specified aspect ratio.

Currently only landscape pictures are supported. (The App should not drastically fail with portrait picutres but results are less than ideal...)

Most core functionality should be working now

Prerequisites: Python 3.8 (other versions may work), PySimpleGUI, PIL image library, argparse for CLI version.

Tested on Windows 10

Todo:
 - portrait support
 - fix exit button in CLIcore progress bar
 - better UI
 - HiDPI
